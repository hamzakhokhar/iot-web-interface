### Project Overview
We aim to create an IOT (Internet Of Things) architecture that we can use to take information on the hardwareâ€™s environment, process it, send it to a cloud server, and display the information in an easy to read way on a web page that can be accessed by any device for ultimate portability and use

### Implementation 
IoT system consists of three distinct components 
1. Hardware
2. Cloud Service
3. Client

### Hardware
Rasberry Pie 3 B+ running node.js

### Cloud Service
Amazon Web Services connected thru MQTT and HTTPS transmission protocols

### Client
Client is where the user interface will be which we are choosing to implement as a webpage written in node.js
